# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM in R






## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network in R using the torch package to predict stock prices. Specifically, it predicts the Open stock price using a time series of 14 days' historical data. The model processes these sequences of daily stock prices and forecasts the price for the next day.
